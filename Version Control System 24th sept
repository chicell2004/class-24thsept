Version Control System
Git ---> version control system (VCS)
Cithhub ---> Source code management/Online code repo (SCM)

TWO TYPES OF VCS
  1. Centralized VCS
  2. Distributed VCS

WHY VCS
    1. To track changes
    2. To retrieve files and backups from accidental deletes

COMMANDS
    ls -la ===> List hidden files and folders and to check whether folder is been tracked by git
    LS -L ===> WD
    git ls-files ===> whether my file is in the SA/LR
    git status ----> to confirm SA/LR

UNTRACKED ----> Means file is in the WD
CHANGES TO BE COMMITTED ---> means file is in SA
WORKING TREE CLEAN -----> Means its in the LR
